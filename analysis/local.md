# Running locally
Now that we have seen how a task is built up, we will take a look at how you can run your analysis task. Basically, there are three options for running a task:

*  Run on **local** data (i.e. some input files that are stored on your laptop)

*  Run on **GRID** (either in test or full mode) yourself

*  Run on GRID using the **LEGO** train system

In this section, we will take a look at option 1: how to run on data that you have stored locally, on your own computer. 

{% callout "Please note" %}
For practical purposes it is (nearly) impossible to process a whole dataset locally on your laptop, but launching a local test provides you with an environment to test your analysis task!
{% endcallout %}

To run a local analysis, we need to

* Compile our code, and
* Launch our analysis

### Steering macros

To do so, we usually use another small macro, commonly referred to as a *steering macro*, which *steers* the analysis. This macro will 
- create an analysis manager and data handler, 
- will define which data files to run on, 
- compile your code, and then 
- instruct the analysis manager to run your analysis. 

An example of a steering macro to run the task `AliAnalysisTaskMyTask` on data that's stored on your laptop, looks as follows:


```cpp
    void runAnalysis() {
        // header location
        gROOT->ProcessLine(".include $ROOTSYS/include");
        gROOT->ProcessLine(".include $ALICE_ROOT/include");

        // create the analysis manager
        AliAnalysisManager *mgr = new AliAnalysisManager("AnalysisMyTask");
        AliAODInputHandler *aodH = new AliAODInputHandler();
        mgr->SetInputEventHandler(aodH);

        // compile the class (locally) with debug symbols
        gROOT->LoadMacro("AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx++g");

        // load the addtask macro
        gROOT->LoadMacro("AddMyTask.C");

        // create an instance of your analysis task
        AliAnalysisTaskMyTask *task = AddMyTask();

        // if you want to run locally, we need to define some input
        TChain* chain = new TChain("aodTree");
        chain->Add("/scratch/.../AliAOD.root");

        // start the analysis locally
        mgr->StartAnalysis("local", chain);
    }
```

Read the above code snippet line-by-line, and try to understand the comments. 

## Running

To run your analysis, it will now suffice to type in a terminal (after sourcing the AliRoot environment): 
```
aliroot runAnalysis.C 
```

This will trigger executing of the steering macro, which will in turn launch the analysis. If all goes well, this minimal task should produce one histogram, which looks like

## Try for yourself? 

If you want to try this for yourself, you can now go through steps 1 through 5 of the 'Analysis tutorial exercises'.
