# How to write your analysis task for AliPhysics

The basic goal of this introduction is to explain to you how you can *write* and *run* a minimal analysis task for the AliPhysics analysis framework. This task will not give you any real 'physics' results, it's just a minimal example of what you need to do a data analysis for the ALICE experiment. 

At the end of this introduction, you will *understand* what happens in your analysis task, and you will understand how to run it on your laptop, on the Grid, and in 'LEGO-trains', what all of this means will become clear later on. After you have read this introduction, you can follow steps 1 through 6, which will give you hands-on experience with building an analysis from the grounds up, and running it. These steps will require you to have access to a working AliPhysics build, to obtain this, see [this ref|this ref].
