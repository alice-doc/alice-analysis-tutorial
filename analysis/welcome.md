# How to write your analysis task for AliPhysics

The goal of this introduction is to explain to you how you can *write* and *run* a minimal analysis task for the AliPhysics analysis framework. This task will not give you any real 'physics' results, it's just a minimal example of what you need know to do a data analysis for the ALICE experiment. It is assumed that you have basic knowledge of both C++ and ROOT.

At the end of this introduction, you will *understand* what happens in your analysis task, and you will understand how to run it on your laptop, on the Grid, and in 'LEGO-trains'. What all of this means will become clear later on. After you have read this introduction, you can follow steps 1 through 7 of the *Analysis tutorial exercises*, which will give you hands-on experience with building an analysis from the grounds up, and running it. This of course requires that you have a working version of the ALICE software stack available on your computer.
