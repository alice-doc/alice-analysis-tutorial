# Writing a *mini-analysis*

In the following exercises, you will write a very small, but realistic, data analysis from the grounds up. The starting point is a minimal task that fills a histogram with a transverse momentum distribution. This task has already been written for you. As you go along, you will add code to this task, so that in the end, you can run a mini-analysis measuring the centrality dependence of charged pions production at mid-rapidity. 

These exercises assume that you have read the previous section ('Writing an analysis task'). 

To access ALICE data and run the analysis on the Grid, you will need to be an ALICE member (a CERN lightweight account does not suffice). When in doubt about this, ask your supervisor.
