# Writing a *mini-analysis*

In the following exercises, you will write a very small, but realistic, data analysis from the grounds up. The starting point is a minimal task that fills a histogram with a transverse momentum distribution. This task has already been written for you. As you go along, you will add code to this task, so that in the end, you can run a mini-analysis measuring the centrality dependence of charged pions production at mid-rapidity. 

The exercises were originally used to accompany a set of lectures [that you can find here, (check the Thursday)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/666222/timetable/#20171102). However, you can be followed without having attended the lecture. 

To access ALICE data and run the analysis on the Grid, you will need to be an ALICE member (a CERN lightweight account does not suffice). When in doubt about this, ask your supervisor.
