# Setup of a *mini-analysis*

In the following exercises, you will write a very small, but realistic, data analysis from the grounds up. The starting point is a minimal task that fills a histogram with a transverse momentum distribution. As you go along, you will add code to this task, so that in the end, you can run a mini-analysis measuring the centrality dependence of charged pions production at mid-rapidity. 

The exercises were originally used to accompany a set of lectures - [that you can find here, check the Thursday](https://indico.cern.ch/event/666222/timetable/#20171102) - but can be followed without having been present at the lecture (but of course you can take a look at the slides). To access ALICE data and run the analysis on the GRID, you will need to be an ALICE member (a CERN lightweight account does not suffice).
