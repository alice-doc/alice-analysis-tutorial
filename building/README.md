How to build ALICE software
===========================

The ALICE experiment currently has two frameworks:

* [AliRoot](https://github.com/alisw/AliRoot)/[AliPhysics](https://github.com/alisw/AliPhysics) for
  LHC Run 1 and Run 2
* [O2](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2), currently under development, for Run 3 software

Building software has become an increasingly complicated operation, as our software has many
dependencies and we expect it to work both on your laptop and on the Grid. In addition, we support
many Linux distributions and recent macOS versions.

{% callout "Please follow the instructions closely!" %}
Most of the paths and procedures presented here can be adapted to your system and your taste. You
can for instance decide to use different path names, or a different directory structure, it's up to
you, however we **do not recommend you use different ways of installing the required
dependencies.**

In case you do not have particular needs, or you don't know what you are doing, please follow the procedure **very carefully and without diverging from it at all**.

This will make support easier in case something does not work as expected.

## aliBuild

ALICE uses aliBuild to build software. aliBuild:

* knows how to build software via [per-package recipes](https://github.com/alisw/alidist),
* manages the dependencies consistently,
* rebuilds only what's necessary,
* allows several versions of the same software to be installed at the same time.


## Your operating system

There are different prerequisites depending on your operating system. The following list represents
what we support. If your operating system is in the list below, click on it to know what to do
_before_ proceeding with the ALICE software installation.

If you are in doubt about what operating system to install on your new laptop, the list below might
be helpful.

If your operating system is _not_ in the list below, it does not mean our software won't work on it;
it will be just more difficult for you to get support for it. We will be happy to add proper
documentation for additional operating systems!

* [macOS Sierra (10.12) and High Sierra (10.13)](prereq-macos.md)
* [Ubuntu 17.10 and 16.04 LTS](prereq-ubuntu.md)


## Get or upgrade aliBuild

Install or upgrade [aliBuild](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/alibuild/) with `pip`:

```bash
sudo pip install alibuild --upgrade
```

Now add the two following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` (depending on your
configuration):

```bash
export ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR="$HOME/alice/sw"
eval "`alienv shell-helper`"
```

The first line tells what directory is used as "build cache", the second line installs a "shell
helper" that makes easier to run certain aliBuild-related commands.

You need to close and reopen your terminal for the change to be effective. The directory
`~/alice/sw` will be created the first time you run aliBuild.

> Note that this directory tends to grow in size over time, and it is the one you need to remove in
> case of cleanups.


### I don't have root permissions

In case you don't have root permissions, the most general way of installing aliBuild is to specify
a user directory where to install it. Start with opening your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` (this
depends on your system), and add the following lines:

```bash
export PYTHONUSERBASE="$HOME/user_python"
export PATH="$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH"
```

Now close all your terminals and reopen them to load the new configuration. Check if it works by
printing the variable:

```bash
echo $PYTHONUSERBASE
```

The operations above need to be performed only once. Now, to install or upgrade aliBuild, just do:

```bash
pip install alibuild --upgrade --user
```

> This time we did not specify `sudo` and we have added the `--user` option. The Python variable
> `PYTHONUSERBASE` tells `pip` where to install the package.

Verify you have `aliBuild` in your path:

```bash
type aliBuild
```


### I want a special version of aliBuild

In some cases you might want to install a "release candidate" version, or you want to get the code
directly from GitHub. By default, the last stable version is installed. **Do not install a special
version of aliBuild if you were not instructed to do so or if you don't know what you are doing, we
provide no support for unstable releases!**

To install a release candidate (for instance, `v1.5.1rc3`):

```bash
sudo pip install alibuild=v1.5.1rc3 --upgrade
```

To install from GitHub (you can specify a tag or a hash, or another branch, instead of `master`):

```bash
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/alisw/alibuild@master --upgrade
```

> Do not forget to drop `sudo` and add `--user` in case you do not have root permissions!


## Build ALICE software

ALICE software is made of several dependencies, and aliBuild takes care of downloading them for you.
If you have exported the `$ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR` variable as described above, source code for all
dependencies will be "hidden" there. You want, however, to be able to see and control the source
code for the components you are developing: in our example we will show how to do that for AliRoot,
AliPhysics and (if you also develop Run 3 software) O2.


### Initialize or update your work area

We will assume our work area is `~/alice`. Let's create it and download the source of the packages
we need to develop.

```bash
mkdir ~/alice
cd ~/alice
```

For Run 2 software:

```bash
aliBuild init AliRoot,AliPhysics
```

For Run 3 software (you can have both Run 2 and Run 3 source code under the same directory):

```bash
aliBuild init O2 --defaults o2
```

> Do not forget the `--defaults o2`, aliBuild will complain if you don't specify it.

The commands above will finish with a message like:

```
==> Development directory . created for aliroot, aliphysics
```

If you do `ls`, you will see the AliRoot, AliPhysics and O2 directories, plus an additional alidist
directory: this is the place containing the software recipes, telling aliBuild how to construct our
software, and you can ignore it.

{% callout "Software and recipes must be updated manually!" %}
`aliBuild init` downloads software, and the recipes directory, for you the first time, but then they
will behave like any other Git directory and aliBuild will never update them any longer. You will
need to take care of the update yourself.

This means, in most cases, moving into the software directory and doing something like:

```bash
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull
```

Note that the operation above differs for O2 (where the default branch is `dev`, not `master`), and
the `git reset --hard` command is destructive: it will align your repository to the upstream one by
making you lose all your local changes.
{% endcallout %}


### Check your prerequisites

aliBuild comes with the command `aliDoctor` that will help you identifying if your prerequisites
were installed correctly. In general, aliBuild is capable of building all required software
dependencies, but it has also the ability to take them "from the system" if possible, resulting in
less time spent for building for you.

Run the `aliDoctor` command to check dependencies for Run 2 software:

```bash
cd ~/alice
aliDoctor AliPhysics
```

For Run 2 software based on ROOT 6 (note: this is the only option on macOS):

```bash
cd ~/alice
aliDoctor AliPhysics --defaults root6
```

For Run 3 software:

```bash
cd ~/alice
aliDoctor O2 --defaults o2
```

aliDoctor will warn you that some packages have to be built as they could not be found from the
system. If you have followed the instructions, this list should contain **nothing more than**:

* boost
* CMake
* GSL
* nanomsg
* protobuf
* Vc
* yaml-cpp
* ZeroMQ

In particular, you should never have `Python` or `Python-modules`. If the output is longer than this
list, please go through the prerequisites once again and run `aliDoctor` again. If the output
contains those packages, or less packages, then you are fine and you may continue.

> If you think a package is shown but should not be in the list because you are sure you have
> installed it, it might just be that its version it's incompatible (this frequently happens with
> `CMake`) or you are missing the "development" package for that component.


### Build and rebuild

If you have followed the prerequisites part thoroughly, and if you have double-checked it with
`aliDoctor`, it's time to run your build.

Remember that you have checked out _manually_ the sources for AliRoot, AliPhysics and O2, so before
building make sure your sources are up to date by following the instructions above.

There are different ways of building Run 2 software depending on your configuration and your
desired features. The build command is:

```bash
cd ~/alice
aliBuild build AliPhysics [--defaults DEFAULTS]
```

Choose your `--defaults` accordingly:

| Defaults     | ROOT 6 | GEANT3, 4, DPMJET | Works on macOS |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| `<none>`     | no     | yes               | no             |
| `user`       | no     | no _(faster)_     | no             |
| `root6`      | yes    | yes               | yes            |
| `user-root6` | yes    | no _(faster)_     | yes            |

Note that **it is mandatory to use ROOT 6 on macOS**. ROOT 5 builds do not work there. In most cases
the `user` (and `user-root6`) installation is sufficient and takes less time and disk space.

You will need to run the **exact same command** when rebuilding, with the same `--defaults` option.

The same command is used both for building the first time, and rebuilding: aliBuild is smart and
**it will rebuild only what changed**.

{% callout "Why has aliBuild rebuilt everything!?!? ðŸ˜ ðŸ¤¬" %}
One or more of the following actions might change the way aliBuild sees and uses the dependencies
and might result in a **full** (or almost full) rebuild. So, if an important conference is
approaching, **plan the following actions accordingly as they might increase the build time**:

* Updating recipes in `alidist`
* Removing the cache `$ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR` or forgetting to export the variable
* Adding or removing system dependencies as seen by `aliDoctor`
* Updating your operating system or compilers (including Xcode on macOS)
{% endcallout %}

If you need to build Run 3 software, simply do:

```bash
aliBuild build O2 --defaults o2
```

on every platform.
