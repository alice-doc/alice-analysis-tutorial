Build ALICE software
====================

There are two ways of building ALICE software on your computer:

üß™ [Install ALICE software with alibuild](custom.md)

_This option provides users with a way to build the ALICE software directly on their system. On CC7
you will benefit from precompiled binaries which will make you save plenty of time. This method
works on any modern Linux distribution and macOS._

üê≥ [Install ALICE software with alidock](https://github.com/alidock/alidock/wiki)

_This option provide users with a consistent environment based on containers. On non-CC7 systems you
will benefit from precompiled binaries which will make you save plenty of time. This method works on
any modern Linux distribution and macOS but **does not offer support for OpenGL GUIs**._
